<h1 align=center>Elevate</h1>

## Abstract
Elevate is a mock take home project where I created a website using the News API to view the most popular current news articles.
## Project Viewing
Unfortunately, since the app uses Secret API Keys through the News API, it's unable to be pulled down and run locally but you can view it from this link.

- Challenge my time management with little time to make a project
- Challenge my abilities to describe my work process

## Wins + Challenges
